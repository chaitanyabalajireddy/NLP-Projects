# Sentiment Analysis Using RNN with Pretrained Embeddings

This project showcases the implementation of a sentiment analysis task utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained on embeddings derived from pretrained Word2Vec and FastText models. The essence of the project lies in its ability to leverage the nuanced semantic understanding encapsulated within these embeddings, enhancing the RNN's ability to discern sentiment from textual data.

## Overview

The workflow is segmented into distinct phases, starting with data preprocessing, moving through the training of the RNN model with both types of embeddings, and culminating in a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across various metrics.

### Data Preprocessing

The initial step involves cleaning and preparing the textual data for training. This includes tokenizing the text, removing stopwords, and converting the text into sequences that the neural network can process. This phase ensures the text data is in a suitable form for both training the model and utilizing the pretrained embeddings effectively.

### Embedding Matrix Preparation

With the textual data preprocessed, the next phase involves loading the pretrained Word2Vec and FastText models. These models are used to create embedding matrices that represent the text data. Each word in the dataset is mapped to a corresponding vector in the embedding space, providing a rich representation that captures the semantic relationships between words.

### RNN Model Construction and Training

The core of the project involves constructing an RNN model tailored for sentiment analysis. The model architecture includes an embedding layer, initialized with the prepared embedding matrices, followed by bidirectional LSTM layers and a dense output layer. This configuration is designed to process the sequential nature of text, allowing the model to learn from the context provided by the embeddings.

The RNN model is trained separately with embeddings from the Word2Vec and FastText models. This dual training approach allows for an exploration of the performance impact of different types of embeddings on the sentiment analysis task.

### Performance Evaluation

Post-training, the model's performance is rigorously evaluated on a test dataset. The evaluation focuses on key metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. These metrics provide a holistic view of the model's effectiveness, showcasing its ability to classify sentiment accurately.

#### Accuracy
Reflects the overall correctness of the model in classifying the sentiment.

#### Precision and Recall
Offer insights into the model's ability to minimize false positives and false negatives, respectively, providing a nuanced understanding of its predictive capabilities.

#### AUC for ROC
Illustrates the model's classification performance across different threshold settings, offering a measure of its robustness.

### Visualization

The project includes a visualization component, where the performance metrics over the training epochs are plotted. This visualization aids in identifying trends such as overfitting or underfitting and provides a graphical representation of the model's learning progress. Separate graphs for each performance metric elucidate the model's strengths and areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

By utilizing pretrained Word2Vec and FastText embeddings within an RNN framework, this project demonstrates a potent approach to sentiment analysis. The methodical training, evaluation, and visualization of the model's performance furnish valuable insights, paving the way for further enhancements and exploration in the realm of natural language processing.
